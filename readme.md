Zeitfenster buchungsportal

Time slot booking portal
We created a time slot booking portal with NodeJS using VueJS and a Postgresql database.
A time slot booking is necessary to organize the utilization of a warehouse with your loading gates. https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitfenstermanagement
There should be a frontend on which a forwarding company with a reference and a zip code can log on to the portal.
If you register with reference and post code (OneTimeReference) the details of the program should be displayed to the user.
